Note 3 to entry: Any anomalies that are detected are usually addressed by rework, followed by a walk-through of the reworked work products ( 3.185 ).

EXAMPLE During  a  walk-through,  the  developer  explains  the work product ( 3.185)  step-by-step  to  one  or more reviewers. The objective is to create a common understanding of the work product ( 3.185) and to identify any safety anomalies ( 3.134 ) within the work product ( 3.185 ). Both inspections ( 3.82) and walk-throughs are types of peer review ( 3.127), where a walk-through is a less stringent form of peer review ( 3.127 ) than an inspection ( 3.82 ).

## 3.183

## warning and degradation strategy

specification of how to alert the driver of potentially reduced functionality and of how to provide this reduced functionality to reach a safe state ( 3.131 )

Note 1 to entry: The warning and degradation strategy includes:

- -   the specification of haptic, audio or visual cues to alert the driver for upcoming degradation ( 3.28);
- -   the description of one or more safe states ( 3.131 ) associated with the corresponding safety goals ( 3.139);
- -   the conditions for transitioning to a safe state ( 3.131);
- -   the conditions for recovering from a safe state ( 3.131) and, if applicable, the corresponding maximum time to repair time interval ( 3.89); and
- -   if applicable, emergency operation ( 3.43 ) and associated emergency operation tolerance time interval ( 3.45 ).

## 3.184

## well-trusted

previously used without known safety anomalies ( 3.134 ) in a comparable application

EXAMPLE Well-trusted design principle; well-trusted tool; well-trusted hardware component ( 3.21 ).

## 3.185

## work product

documentation resulting from one or more associated requirements of ISO 26262

Note 1 to entry: The documentation can be in the form of a single document containing the complete information for the work product or a set of documents that together contain the complete information for the work product.
