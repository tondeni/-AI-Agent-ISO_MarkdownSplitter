| 5 Item definition                       | The objectives of this Clause are: a) to define and describe the item, its functionality, dependencies on, and interac - tion with, the driver, the environment and other items at the vehicle level; and b) to support an adequate under - standing of the item so that the activities in subsequent phases can be performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | None                                                                                                                                     | 5.5.1 Item definition resulting from require - ments in 5.4.                                                                                                                                          |
| 6 Hazard anal- ysis and risk assessment | The objectives of this Clause are: a) to identify and to classify the haz - ardous events caused by malfunctioning behaviour of the item; and b) to formulate the safety goals with their corresponding ASILs related to the prevention or mitigation of the hazardous events, in order to avoid unreasonable risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Item definition (see 5.5.1)                                                                                                              | 6.5.1 Hazard analysis and risk assessment report re- sulting from requirements 6.4.1 to 6.4.5. 6.5.2 Verification report of the hazard analysis and risk assessment resulting from requirement 6.4.6. |
| 7 Functional safe- ty concept           | The objectives of this Clause are: a) to specify the functional or de - graded functional behaviour of the item in accordance with its safety goals; b) to specify the constraints regard - ing suitable and timely detection and con - trol of relevant faults in accordance with its safety goals; c) to specify the item level strategies or measures to achieve the required fault tolerance or adequately mitigate the effects of relevant faults by the item itself, by the driver or by external measures; d) to allocate the functional safety requirements to the system architectural design, or to external measures; and e) to verify the functional safety concept and specify the safety validation criteria. | Item definition (see 5.5.1) Hazard analysis and risk assessment report (see 6.5.1) System architec - tural design (from external source) | 7.5.1 Functional safety concept resulting from requirements 7.4.1 to 7.4.3. 7.5.2 Verification report of the functional safety concept resulting from requirements in 7.4.4.                          |
