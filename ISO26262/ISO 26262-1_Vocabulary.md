## Road vehicles - Functional safety -

## Part 1:

## Vocabulary

## 1 Scope

This document is intended to be applied to safety-related systems that include one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems and that are installed in series production road vehicles, excluding mopeds. This document does not address unique E/E systems in special vehicles such as E/E systems designed for drivers with disabilities.

NOTE Other dedicated application-specific safety standards exist and can complement the ISO 26262 series of standards or vice versa.

Systems and their components released for production, or systems and their components already under development prior to the publication date of this document, are exempted from the scope of this edition. This document addresses alterations to existing systems and their components released for production prior to the publication of this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle depending on the alteration. This document addresses integration of existing systems not developed according to this document and systems developed according to this document by tailoring the safety lifecycle.

This document addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems, including interaction of these systems. It does not address hazards related to electric shock, fire, smoke, heat, radiation, toxicity, flammability, reactivity, corrosion, release of energy and similar hazards, unless directly caused by malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems.

This  document  describes  a  framework  for  functional  safety  to  assist  the  development  of  safetyrelated E/E systems. This framework is intended to be used to integrate functional safety activities into a company-specific development framework. Some requirements have a clear technical focus to implement functional safety into a product; others address the development process and can therefore be seen as process requirements in order to demonstrate the capability of an organization with respect to functional safety.

This document defines the vocabulary of terms used in the ISO 26262 series of standards.

## 3.16

## candidate

item ( 3.84 ) or element ( 3.41) whose definition and conditions of use are identical to, or have a very high degree of commonality with, an item ( 3.84 ) or element ( 3.41) that is already released and in operation

Note 1 to entry: This definition applies where candidate is used in the context of a proven in use argument ( 3.115 ).

## 3.17

## cascading failure

failure ( 3.50 ) of an element ( 3.41 ) of an item ( 3.84) resulting from a root cause [inside or outside of the element ( 3.41)] and then causing a failure ( 3.50 ) of another element ( 3.41 ) or elements ( 3.41 ) of the same or different item ( 3.84 )

Note 1 to entry: Cascading failures are dependent failures ( 3.29 ) that could be one of the possible root causes of a common cause failure ( 3.18 ). See Figure 2.

Figure 2 - Cascading failure

<!-- image -->

## 3.18 common cause failure CCF

failure ( 3.50 ) of two or more elements ( 3.41 ) of an item ( 3.84) resulting directly from a single specific event or root cause which is either internal or external to all of these elements ( 3.41 )

Figure 3 - Common cause failure

<!-- image -->

## 3.19

## common mode failure

## CMF

case of CCF ( 3.18 ) in which multiple elements ( 3.41 ) fail in the same manner

Note 1 to entry: Failure ( 3.50) in the same manner does not necessarily mean that they need to fail exactly the same. How close the failure modes ( 3.51) need to be in order to be classified as common mode failure depends on the context.

EXAMPLE 1 A system ( 3.163 )  has  two  temperature  sensors  which  are  compared  with  each  other.  If  the difference between the two temperature sensors is larger than or equal to 5 Â°C it is handled as a fault ( 3.54 ) and the system ( 3.163 ) is switched into a safe state ( 3.131 ). A common mode failure lets both temperature sensors fail in such a way that the difference between the two sensors is smaller than 5 Â°C and therefore is not detected.

EXAMPLE 2 In a CPU lockstep architecture ( 3.1) where the outputs of both CPUs are compared cycle by cycle, both CPUs need to fail exactly the same way in order for the failure ( 3.50) to go undetected. In this context, a common mode failure lets both CPUs fail exactly the same way.

EXAMPLE 3 An over voltage failure ( 3.50) due to lots of parts not meeting their specification for over voltage is a common mode failure.

EXAMPLE 2 XML files to control the build tools or toolchain.

Note 1 to entry: Configuration data controls the software build. Configuration data is used to select code from existing code variants already defined in the code base. The functionality of selected code variant will be included in the executable code.

Note 2 to entry: Since configuration data is only used to select code variants, configuration data does not include code that is executed or interpreted during the use of the item ( 3.84 ).

Note 1 to entry: Dependent failures can manifest themselves simultaneously, or within a sufficiently short time interval, to have the effect of simultaneous failures ( 3.50 ).

Note 2 to entry: Dependent failures include common cause failures ( 3.18 ) and cascading failures ( 3.17 ).

Note 3 to entry: Whether a given failure ( 3.50 ) is a cascading failure ( 3.17 ) or a common cause failure ( 3.18) may depend on the hierarchical structure of the elements ( 3.41 ).

Note 4 to entry: Whether a given failure ( 3.50 ) is a cascading failure ( 3.17 ) or a common cause failure ( 3.18) may depend on the temporal behaviour of the elements ( 3.41 ).

Note 5 to entry: Dependent failures can include software failures ( 3.50) even if the probability of the failure ( 3.50 ) is not calculated.

different solutions satisfying the same requirement, with the goal of achieving independence ( 3.78 )

Note 1 to entry: Diversity does not guarantee independence ( 3.78), but can deal with certain types of common cause failures ( 3.18 ).

Note  2  to  entry:  Diversity  can  be  a  technical  solution  [diverse  hardware components ( 3.21),  diverse  SW components ( 3.21)] or a technical means (e.g. diverse compiler) to apply.

failure ( 3.50 )  resulting  from  the  combination  of  two  independent  hardware faults ( 3.54 )  that  leads directly to the violation of a safety goal ( 3.139 )

Note 1 to entry: Dual-point failures are multiple-point failures ( 3.96 ) of order 2.

Note 2 to entry: Dual-point failures that are addressed in the ISO 26262 series of standards include those where one fault ( 3.54 ) affects a safety-related element ( 3.144 ) and another fault ( 3.54 ) affects the corresponding safety mechanism ( 3.142 ) intended to achieve or maintain a safe state ( 3.131 ).

## 3.39

## dual-point fault

individual fault ( 3.54) that, in combination with another independent fault ( 3.54), leads to a dual-point failure ( 3.38 )

Note 1 to entry: A dual-point fault can only be recognized after the identification of a dual-point failure ( 3.38), e.g. from cut set analysis of a fault tree.

## 3.49

## external measure

measure that is separate and distinct from the item ( 3.84 ) which reduces or mitigates the risks ( 3.128 ) resulting from the item ( 3.84 )

## 3.50

## failure

termination  of  an  intended  behaviour  of  an element ( 3.41 )  or  an item ( 3.84 )  due  to  a fault ( 3.54 ) manifestation

Note 1 to entry: Termination can be permanent or transient.

manner in which an element ( 3.41 ) or an item ( 3.84 ) fails to provide the intended behaviour

## 3.52

## failure mode coverage

## FMC

proportion of the failure rate ( 3.53 ) of a failure mode ( 3.51 ) of a hardware element ( 3.41 ) that is detected or controlled by the implemented safety mechanism ( 3.142 )

## 3.53

Note 1 to entry: The failure rate is assumed to be constant and is generally denoted as 'Î»'.

## 3.54 fault

abnormal condition that can cause an element ( 3.41 ) or an item ( 3.84 ) to fail

Note 1 to entry: Permanent, intermittent, and transient faults ( 3.173) (especially soft errors) are considered.

Note 2 to entry: When a subsystem is in an error ( 3.46 ) state it could result in a fault for the system ( 3.163 ).

Note 3 to entry: An intermittent fault occurs from time to time and then disappears again. This type of fault can occur when a component ( 3.21) is on the verge of breaking down or, for example, due to an internal malfunction in a switch. Some systematic faults ( 3.165 ) (e.g. timing irregularities) could lead to intermittent faults.

## 3.55

## fault detection time interval

## FDTI

time-span from the occurrence of a fault ( 3.54 ) to its detection

Note 1 to entry: See Figure 5.

Note 2 to entry: Fault detection time interval is determined independently of diagnostic test time interval ( 3.35 ).

EXAMPLE The fault detection time interval of a diagnostic test can be longer than the diagnostic test time interval ( 3.35 ) due to implemented error ( 3.46) counters, i.e. the fault ( 3.54) must be detected more than once by the diagnostic test before triggering an error ( 3.46 ) reaction.

Note 3 to entry: Fault detection time interval, diagnostic test time interval ( 3.35), and fault reaction time interval ( 3.59 ) are relevant characteristics of a safety mechanism ( 3.142 ) based on fault ( 3.54 ) detection.

Note  4  to  entry:  A fault ( 3.54)  is  timely  covered  by  the  corresponding safety  mechanism ( 3.142 )  if  the  fault detection time interval plus the fault reaction time interval ( 3.59 ) is lower than the relevant fault tolerant time interval ( 3.61 ).

## 3.56 fault handling time interval FHTI

sum of fault detection time interval ( 3.55 ) and the fault reaction time interval ( 3.59 )

Note 1 to entry: The FHTI is a property of a safety mechanism ( 3.142 ).

## 3.57

## fault injection

method to evaluate the effect of a fault ( 3.54 ) within an element ( 3.41) by inserting faults ( 3.54), errors ( 3.46), or failures ( 3.50) in order to observe the reaction by observation points ( 3.101 )

Note 1 to entry: Fault injection can be performed at various levels of abstraction including item ( 3.84 ) or element ( 3.41) level depending on the scope, feasibility, observability and level of required detail. Depending on purpose, it can be performed at different stages of the safety lifecycle and by considering different fault models ( 3.58 ).

EXAMPLE 1 Injecting faults ( 3.54)  during  operation  to  verify  that  a safety  mechanism ( 3.142 )  is  working properly as part of a strategy to detect latent faults ( 3.85 ).

EXAMPLE 2 Injecting faults ( 3.54 ) during integration test through hardware debug ports or through dedicated software commands to test the hardware-software interface (HSI).

EXAMPLE 3 Simulating stuck-at faults ( 3.54) or transient faults at hardware component level to verify the diagnostic coverage ( 3.33 )  of  a safety mechanism ( 3.142) or to identify faults ( 3.54) which may result in errors ( 3.46 ) or failures ( 3.50 ).

## 3.58

Note 1 to entry: See Figure 5.

Note 2 to entry: The minimum time-span is to be evaluated over all hazardous events ( 3.77 ). It can depend on the characterization of the hazards ( 3.75 ).

Note 3 to entry: FTTI is related to a hazard ( 3.75) caused by a malfunctioning behaviour ( 3.88 ) of the item ( 3.84 ). FTTI is a relevant attribute for safety goals ( 3.139 ) derived from this hazard ( 3.75 ).

Note 4 to entry: A fault ( 3.54) is timely covered by a safety mechanism ( 3.142), if the item ( 3.84 ) is maintained in a safe state ( 3.131), or if the item ( 3.84 ) is transitioned to a safe state ( 3.131), or is transitioned to an emergency operation ( 3.43), within the relevant fault tolerant time interval.

Note 5 to entry: The occurrence of a hazardous event ( 3.77 ) is dependent on a fault ( 3.54 ) being present and a vehicle being in a scenario that allows the fault ( 3.54 ) to affect vehicle behaviour.

EXAMPLE A failure ( 3.50 ) in the brake system ( 3.163) may not result in a hazardous event ( 3.77 ) until the brakes are applied.

Note 6 to entry: While the FTTI is defined only at the item ( 3.84) level, at the element ( 3.41) level the maximum fault handling time interval ( 3.56 ) and the state to be achieved after fault handling to support the functional safety concept ( 3.68) can be specified.

Note 7 to entry: The fault detection time interval ( 3.55) may include multiple diagnostic test time intervals ( 3.35 ) to allow de-bouncing of errors ( 3.46 ) if the diagnostic test time interval ( 3.35) is sufficiently shorter than the fault detection time interval ( 3.55 ).

EXAMPLE During  a  walk-through,  the  developer  explains  the work product ( 3.185)  step-by-step  to  one  or more reviewers. The objective is to create a common understanding of the work product ( 3.185) and to identify any safety anomalies ( 3.134 ) within the work product ( 3.185 ). Both inspections ( 3.82) and walk-throughs are types of peer review ( 3.127), where a walk-through is a less stringent form of peer review ( 3.127 ) than an inspection ( 3.82 ).
